Weekly Roadmap 
- We have the title of the container named "Weekly Roadmap".
- On the complete right of the title, we have "This Week" and "Next Week" button.
- add component that has all courses based off weekly roadmap.
- Component has due date on top (in muted), effort in tag (use shadcn tag component), add a bit of vertical spacing, add task title in bold, course code info in muted, and task status which we can swap status by clicking on the "next" icon to switch to next status (clickup style)
- We can also add a task in a specific day when hovering over a day. If no tasks for that day, just display the add task content.
brainstorm, ask questions if you have any.
